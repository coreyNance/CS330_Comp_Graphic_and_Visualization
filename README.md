## 1. How do I approach designing software?

With this project, the main hurdle is the whole idea of designing.  Math calculations and general data manipulation is one thing, but trying
to create an image is a whole other hurdle.  Overall, the work on this project helped to better craft the skill of thinking in terms of a 
graph rather than just trying to picture how to render an object.  The process was to first think of the object that is to be rendered, then  think of the size of that object and where the starting vertex would be.  Once that is set up, then the next part of the process is thinking of the size and where the vertex should be placed in order to achieve that size and location.  In the end the main tactic that can be taken from this design approach and used in further work is to start small. Meaning, get a good idea of what the objective is and then break it down into as many small tasks as you can.  Then complete each task while still keeping the end goal in mand.


## 2. How do I approach developing programs?

Most of my development experiences have been with working with incoming data and doing some sort of calculations or sorting with it.  With this project, needing to render an object  was a completely different challenge.  With this, the strategy had to be to think more along the lines of a bullseye target set in the middle of the rendered object and then creating the outsides. 
The only iteration factor that was used in this project was with creating the rendered object on the screen. In the beginning, I thought of the renderings like drawing in microsoft paint.  Basically make a line, and then keep changing it until the desired angle is achieved.  As the course went on, my thought processed changed from thinking in a drawing aspect to thinking about everything in a graph plane type of way with using vertices to do the drawing and not the lines themselves. The lines are just a connector of the vertices. 


## 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

With computational graphics and visualization, the skills learned here have to do with more with object rendering.  But it also has to do with taking in spacial awareness meaning to understanding the surroundings of the object and the angles in which it can be looked at.  When thinking of this, there are alot of small parts of the code that work together to create the program and understanding how each of these small parts work is essential to any code development.  This biggest skill that will help me in my educational and professional pathway is the ability to break down major tasks into smaller ones but still understanding how they are develop the big picture.
